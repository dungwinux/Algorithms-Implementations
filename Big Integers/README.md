# Big Integers library

_Work in progress. May be unstable. Partially untested._

Currently stable:
- Constructors
    - Constructor with default value (= 0)
    
    - Constructor with given value (as string)
        (string starting with minus sign will be automatically detected and parsed correctly)

    - Constructor with given value (as string, sign given)
        (note: the given sign will override the sign detected from string, if any)
        
    - Constructor with given value (as `long long int`)
