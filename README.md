### A repository storing pieces of code implementing common data structures and algorithms.

Note that:
- some snippets require `llint` to be defined as a type of integers (`int64_t`, `long`, etc.) for storing indices & values
- some requires specific header files to be included upon compilation.
  Unless GNU G++ is used, it is recommended to include STL by hand, since some snippets use `bits/stdc++.h`, which is not C++ standard.
